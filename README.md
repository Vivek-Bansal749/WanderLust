# Wanderlust

Wanderlust is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, where users can create, view, edit, and search travel listings with images and categories.

This project was built as part of my full stack learning journey and focuses on backend development, database design, and real-world features like image upload, validation, and filtering.
